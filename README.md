# NewBreakpoint
Building on top of existing class project for fun, mostly completely refactoring old code and adding new features.
Also for you Samara, I decided to keep the incorrect title. 


GIT HUB:

For some pushes we can just use the push button?
Get some standardized git instructions

When adding a new local repository (basically a workspace):
-Make the remote repository on github.com
-Use vscode to make a clone of this (alternatively "git init" turns the file your cd'd in into a repo)
-Make sure you are in the correct folder (the local repo will be your workspace)
-"git status" tells you if you are indeed within a repo

When adding a new remote Repository (you should be in your local cloned repo to do this):
-"git remote add origin" https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
-"git remote -v"



Terminal instructions:
1. "git add" . OR "git add filename1 filename2"
2. "git commit -m"MESSAGE HERE""    >> "git log --oneline" This shows a short list of commits for verification.
3. "git push"
4. just in case if 3 doesn't work use instead (replacing step 3 while retrying): "git push -u origin main"

Step 4's purpose is to set main as the default push location.

When Pulling code:
just write "git pull" and you're done.
