# NewBreakpoint
Building on top of existing class project for fun, mostly completely refactoring old code and adding new features.


GIT HUB:

For some pushes we can just use the push button?
Get some standardized git instructions

Terminal instructions:
1. git add .
2. git commit -m"MESSAGE HERE"
3a. git push
3b. just in case if 3a doesn't work use instead: git push -u origin main
